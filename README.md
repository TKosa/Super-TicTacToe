# Super-TicTacToe
Its like Tic-Tac-Toe, but super.

Players take turns placing X's and O's.
If a player goes in the top right square of a particular board, then the next player must play in the top right board.
The board to play in as highlighted grey

If the board to play in is unplayable, which happens when that board has been won by a player, the current player can choose to play on any playable board.

The game is over when either player gets three board in a row.

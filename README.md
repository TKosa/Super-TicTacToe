# Super-TicTacToe
Its like Tic-Tac-Toe, but super.

Players take turns placing X's and O's.
If a player goes in the top right square of a particular board, then the next player must play in the top right board.
The board to play in is highlighted grey

In this example, blue has won the middle-left board, by going in its top right square. Now, red must play in the top right board.

If a board has been one by a player, it becomes unplayable; no further pieces can be placed in that board.

If the board to play in has been won by a player and is therefore unplayable, the current player can choose any remaining playable tile in the game.

The game is over when either player gets three board in a row.

Players can choose a tile by clicking, or navigating with the arrow keys. The tile with focus is highlighted green. Players can also save and load games, and re-read the rules by clicking the help button.

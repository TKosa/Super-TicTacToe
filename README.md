# Super-TicTacToe
Its like Tic-Tac-Toe, but super.

Players take turns placing X's and O's.
If a player goes in the top right square of a particular board, then the next player must play in the top right board.

If the board to play in is unplayable, which happens what that board has been won by a player, the current player can choose to play on any playable board.

The game is over when either player gets three board in a row.
